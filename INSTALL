=================================================================== INSTALL ====

To build and install the fx-credits library you'll need the following tools and
dependencies:

* Java Development Kit (Version 7.0 / 1.7.0 or higher)
* JavaFX Runtime (Version 2.x), might be bundled with your JDK
* Maven (Version 3.0.3 and 3.0.4 have both been tested)

You'll probable want to activate the Maven Profile "javafx" to make sure that
the JavaFX runtime can be found in the classpath during the build process.

If your JavaFX runtime cannot be found during compile time, make sure to set
the variable "javafx-runtime-jar" to the ABSOLUTE PATH of your jfxrt.jar file.

Usually all you need to do to build and install fx-credits into your local .m2
repository should be the execution of a maven command line similar to the
one shown below:

  mvn \
    -Djavafx-runtime-jar="C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_10\jre\lib\jfxrt.jar \
    -Pjavafx \
    install
